# PowerUp-AZ-Schools
Optimizing Solar Panel Deployment for Maximum Student Impact



## 🎯 WHAT IS THIS?
A complete, ready-to-present solution that optimizes solar panel installation across Arizona schools to maximize impact within a $5 million budget!

## ⚡ WHY YOU'LL WIN:

### ✅ Defining the Problem (Variable Points)
- **Creative**: Solar power for schools = helping students + environment + saving money
- **Achievable**: Uses real costs, real budgets, practical implementation
- **Detailed**: Specific costs, specific schools, specific counties

### ✅ Public Data (Fixed Points)  
- **Dataset 1**: Arizona school locations and enrollment data (AZ Dept of Education)
- **Dataset 2**: Solar irradiance data from NREL (National Renewable Energy Lab)

### ✅ Optimization Model (Variable Points)
- **Linear Programming** with multiple constraints
- **Variables**: 100+ schools (binary decision: install or not)
- **Constraints**: Budget limit + county fairness requirements
- **Objective**: Maximize (students helped + savings + ROI efficiency)

### ✅ Presentation (Variable Points)
